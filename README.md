## About

* Tower Time was built on HTML5 canvas, and uses the Dijkstra algorithm or 'Brushfire' pathfinding combined with vector movement. It features custom pixel animation and is a fully-featured game, with upgrade / sell options, optional hotkeys to make for a polished user experience, and randomized map generation to always keep the game feeling fresh.
