# Tower Time
Canvas tower defense game.

[Tower Time Live](https://towertime.herokuapp.com/)

Build, upgrade, and sell towers to create a maze for enemies to traverse through, and stop them from reaching the red square! As you play and place towers, the little circles come thirty at a time to try to get from the dark gray square to the red one, and will always find the quickest path there; so the make the quickest path long, and give your towers more time to take down the enemies' health, which grows every level. If you're starting to feel too safe, don't worry, every tenth level, the game gets harder by a hidden multiplier, so stay on your toes and keep those towers upgraded and well positioned. The income and points are increased as well. If you misplaced a tower, don't worry, you can sell it back at full price, unless it has already been upgraded. Tired of clicking around on tower and upgrade buttons? No problem, use hotkeys! They will cancel out anything you have selected to make for a smooth switch between options. Have feedback? I would love to hear it, just send me a message here: [ahrampy.com]( https://www.ahrampy.com). Thanks for taking a look, I hope you enjoy the game!

## About

* Tower Time was built on HTML5 canvas, and uses the Dijkstra algorithm or 'Brushfire' pathfinding combined with vector movement. It features custom pixel animation and is a fully-featured game, with upgrade / sell options, optional hotkeys to make for a polished user experience, and randomized map generation to always keep the game feeling fresh.
